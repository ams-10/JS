//Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.

// If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).

// To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.

// Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.
