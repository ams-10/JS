<!-- when the webpage is loaded, the browser creates a document object model of the page 
the html DOM model is constructed as a tree of objects -->

<!-- the dom is a world wibe web consortium standard
for easy words the html dom is a standard for how to get change and add or delete html elements -->

<!-- in the dom all html elements are objects in which a property is a value you can add or change  -->
<!-- whereas the method is the action to be taken on the objects or elements -->

<!-- for example the innerHTML is used to change the text in html of the <p>content</p> element -->
<!-- example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
     <head>
          <title>innerHTML example</title>
     </head>
     <body>
          <h1><p id="demo" ></p></h1>
          <button id="green">green</button>
          <button id="red">red</button>
          <button id="blue">blue</button>
     </body>
     <script>
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello, World!"; //the text needs to be always passed as strings
                    //the get element by id method is used to access the element of the dom
          //you can also access the other elements using getElementsByTagName or getElementsByclassName

          //now let us create a dynamic button to change the colors of the text
          document.getElementById("red").onclick = function (){
               document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "red";}; //debugging is done through the console in the browser
          document.getElementById("green").onclick = function (){
               document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "green";}; //debugging is done through the console
          document.getElementById("blue").onclick = function (){
               document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "blue";}; //debugging is done through the console if you get errors
          </script>
</html>

<!-- hence this was just a mere taste of how we can manipulate the dom using js code we will see in detail about selecting html elements in detail in the next program -->
